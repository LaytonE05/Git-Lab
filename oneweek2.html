<pre>   
    It&#39;s been one week since you looked at me
Cocked your head to the side and said, &quot;I&#39;m angry&quot;
Five days since you laughed at me saying
&quot;Get back together come back and save me&quot;
Three days since the living room
I realized it&#39;s all my fault, but couldn&#39;t tell you
Yesterday you&#39;d forgiven me
But it&#39;ll still be two days &#39;til I say I&#39;m sorry

Hold it now and watch the hoodwink
As I make you stop, think
You&#39;ll think you&#39;re looking at Aquaman
I summon fish to the dish, although I like the Chalet Swiss
I like the sushi
&#39;Cause it&#39;s never touched a frying pan
Hot like wasabi when I bust rhymes
Big like LeAnn Rimes
Because I&#39;m all about value
Bert Kaempfert&#39;s got the mad hits
You try to match wits, you try to hold me but I bust through
Gonna make a break and take a fake
I&#39;d like a stinking aching shake
I like vanilla, it&#39;s the finest of the flavours
Gotta see the show, &#39;cause then you&#39;ll know
That vertigo is gonna grow
&#39;Cause it&#39;s so dangerous
You&#39;ll have to sign a waiver

How can I help it if I think you&#39;re funny when you&#39;re mad
Trying hard not to smile though I feel bad
I&#39;m the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral
Can&#39;t understand what I mean?
Well, you soon will
I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve
I have a history of taking off my shirt

It&#39;s been one week since you looked at me
Threw your arms in the air
And said, &quot;You&#39;re crazy&quot;
Five days since you tackled me
I&#39;ve still got the rug burns on both my knees
It&#39;s been three days since the afternoon
You realized it&#39;s not my fault
Not a moment too soon
Yesterday you&#39;d forgiven me
And now I sit back and wait &#39;til you say you&#39;re sorry

Chickity China the Chinese chicken
You have a drumstick and your brain stops tickin&#39;
Watchin&#39; X-Files with no lights on
We&#39;re dans la maison
I hope the Smoking Man&#39;s in this one
Like Harrison Ford I&#39;m getting frantic
Like Sting I&#39;m tantric
Like Snickers, guaranteed to satisfy

Like Kurosawa I make mad films
Okay, I don&#39;t make films
But if I did they&#39;d have a Samurai
Gonna get a set a&#39; better clubs
Gonna find the kind with tiny nubs
Just so my irons aren&#39;t always flying off the back-swing
Gotta get in tune with Sailor Moon
&#39;Cause that cartoon has got the boom anime babes
That make me think the wrong thing

How can I help it if I think you&#39;re funny when you&#39;re mad
Tryin&#39; hard not to smile though I feel bad
I&#39;m the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral
Can&#39;t understand what I mean?
You soon will
I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve
I have a history of losing my shirt

It&#39;s been one week since you looked at me
Dropped your arms to your sides
And said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;
Five days since I laughed at you and said
&quot;You just did just what I thought you were gonna do&quot;
Three days since the living room
We realized we&#39;re both to blame
But what could we do?
Yesterday you just smiled at me
Cause it&#39;ll still be two days &#39;til we say we&#39;re sorry

It&#39;ll still be two days &#39;til we say we&#39;re sorry
It&#39;ll still be two days &#39;til we say &quot;Wasabi&quot;
