<p>Just to save you 
I'd give my all<br>
Hey</p>


<p><strong> to save you, I'd give all of me<br>
I can hear you screamin' out, callin' me<br>
It's my fault, made you fall for me<br>
So to save you, I'd give my all <br>
Just to save you, I'd give all of me <br>
I can hear you screamin' out, callin' me <br>
It's my fault, made you fall for me <br>
So to save you, I'd give my all</strong></p>


<p>You fell for me, I count on you when times are tough<br>
Instead of holdin' you down, I should lift you up<br>
It hurts me when you start to see my flaws <br>
But just to save you, I'd risk it all <br>
Short on time for you, I never have enough<br>
When I ran into you, I didn't plan on fallin' in love<br>
Always there to wipe your tears, I hate to see you cry<br>
If you tell me to jump, I'll ask you, "How high?"<br>
I know sometimes it be hard for me to tell the truth<br>
But I go through any obstacle to get to you<br>
I'm not materialistic, but I got a thing for you<br>
Treat the world like my guitar, I'm pullin' strings for you </p>


<p><strong>Just to save you, I'd give all of me<br>
I can hear you screamin' out, callin' me <br>
It's my fault, made you fall for me <br>
So to save you, I'd give my all <br>
Just to save you, I'd give all of me <br>
I can hear you screamin' out, callin' me <br>
It's my fault, made you fall for me <br>
So to save you, I'd give my all</strong></p>

<p> Let me be your hero</p>

<p>You got me down, I was stuck at the bottom<br>
Get out of here, I get you, look at my feet <br>
I remember when it was diamonds<br>
Rose gold, how your diamonds dancin'?<br>
I pick you up in that <a href="https://www.bentleymotors.com/en.html">Bentley</a><br>
You know what I'm sayin'? You inside a McLaren<br>
I'll give you, just promise<br>
Nobody is up out of here, come call me<br>
The way I let you come into my life<br>
And take my heart away, it's like a Rari<br>
Every time you look up on the charts<br>
Now you seein' me, I hope you proud of me<br>
Got you crossed down, <a href="https://www.patek.com/en/home">Patek Philippes</a><br>
Ain't no way you goin' back to college<br>
And I swear that all the shit I've seen the wrongest<br>
Took me out in a public party<br>
Fuckin' with my mass, goin' solar<br>
I won't speak to nobody, I'm sorry<br>
And I save you, you catch me glossed up<br>
Hold on, let me catch my breath<br>
I'm the hero, I'm the last one left</p>

<p><strong>Just to save you, I'd give all of me <br>
I can hear you screamin' out, callin' me<br>
It's my fault, made you fall for me <br>
So to save you, I'd give my all <br>
Just to save you, I'd give all of me <br>
I can hear you screamin' out, callin' me <br>
It's my fault, made you fall for me <br>
So to save you, I'd give my all</strong></p>


<p>Oh-oh <br>
All the people<br>
And all of me</p>
