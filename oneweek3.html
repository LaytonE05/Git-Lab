<h1>One Week by Barenaked Ladies</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>It&#39;s been one week since you looked at me<br/>
Cocked your head to the side and said, &quot;I&#39;m angry&quot;<br/>
Five days since you laughed at me saying<br/>
&quot;Get back together come back and save me&quot;<br/>
Three days since the living room<br/>
I realized it&#39;s all my fault, but couldn&#39;t tell you<br/>
Yesterday you&#39;d forgiven me<br/>
But it&#39;ll still be two days &#39;til I say I&#39;m sorry</strong></p>

<p>Hold it now and watch the hoodwink<br/>
As I make you stop, think<br/>
You&#39;ll think you&#39;re looking at Aquaman<br/>
I summon fish to the dish, although I like the <a rel="noopener" href="http://www.swisschalet.com/">Chalet Swiss</a><br/>
I like the sushi<br/>
&#39;Cause it&#39;s never touched a frying pan</p>

<p>Hot like wasabi when I bust rhymes<br/>
Big like LeAnn Rimes<br/>
Because I&#39;m all about value<br/>
Bert Kaempfert&#39;s got the mad hits<br/>
You try to match wits, you try to hold me but I bust through</p>

<p>Gonna make a break and take a fake<br/>
I&#39;d like a stinking aching shake<br/>
I like vanilla, it&#39;s the finest of the flavours<br/>
Gotta see the show, &#39;cause then you&#39;ll know<br/>
That vertigo is gonna grow<br/>
&#39;Cause it&#39;s so dangerous<br/>
You&#39;ll have to sign a waiver</p>

<p>How can I help it if I think you&#39;re funny when you&#39;re mad<br/>
Trying hard not to smile though I feel bad<br/>
I&#39;m the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral<br/>
Can&#39;t understand what I mean?<br/>
Well, you soon will<br/>
I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve<br/>
I have a history of taking off my shirt</p>

<p>It&#39;s been one week since you looked at me<br/>
Threw your arms in the air<br/>
And said, &quot;You&#39;re crazy&quot;<br/>
Five days since you tackled me<br/>
I&#39;ve still got the rug burns on both my knees<br/>
It&#39;s been three days since the afternoon<br/>
You realized it&#39;s not my fault<br/>
Not a moment too soon<br/>
Yesterday you&#39;d forgiven me<br/>
And now I sit back and wait &#39;til you say you&#39;re sorry</p>

<p>Chickity China the Chinese chicken<br/>
You have a drumstick and your brain stops tickin&#39;<br/>
Watchin&#39; <em>X-Files</em> with no lights on,<br/>
We&#39;re dans la maison<br/>
I hope the Smoking Man&#39;s in this one<br/>
Like Harrison Ford I&#39;m getting frantic<br/>
Like Sting I&#39;m tantric<br/>
Like Snickers, guaranteed to satisfy</p>

<p>Like Kurosawa I make mad films<br/>
Okay, I don&#39;t make films<br/>
But if I did they&#39;d have a Samurai<br/>
Gonna get a set a&#39; better clubs<br/>
Gonna find the kind with tiny nubs<br/>
Just so my irons aren&#39;t always flying off the back-swing<br/>
Gotta get in tune with <a rel="noopener" href="http://www.viz.com/sailor-moon"><cite>Sailor Moon</cite></a><br/>
&#39;Cause that cartoon has got the boom anime babes<br/>
That make me think the wrong thing</p>

<p>How can I help it if I think you&#39;re funny when you&#39;re mad<br/>
Tryin&#39; hard not to smile though I feel bad<br/>
I&#39;m the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral<br/>
Can&#39;t understand what I mean?<br/>
You soon will<br/>
I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve<br/>
I have a history of losing my shirt</p>

<p>It&#39;s been one week since you looked at me<br/>
Dropped your arms to your sides<br/>
And said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;<br/>
Five days since I laughed at you and said<br/>
&quot;You just did just what I thought you were gonna do&quot;<br/>
Three days since the living room<br/>
We realized we&#39;re both to blame<br/>
But what could we do?<br/>
Yesterday you just smiled at me<br/>
Cause it&#39;ll still be two days &#39;til we say we&#39;re sorry </p>

<p>It&#39;ll still be two days &#39;til we say we&#39;re sorry<br/>
It&#39;ll still be two days &#39;til we say &quot;Wasabi&quot;<br/>
